# RetroNet
The 'remake' of my previous terminal game
# What's the change?
Umm, i kinda just rewrote it, but added things like a lot more encoders and decoders and a TUI browser. 
# Why is the code opensource?
The gameplay itself won't be in the source code, but this time it will going to be accessed (mostly) by the TUI browser built-into the game. And about the TUI browser - I tried to use Lynx, but you would be required to download it manually..
